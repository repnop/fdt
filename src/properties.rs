///
/// The `compatible` property value consists of one or more strings that define
/// the specific programming model for the device. This list of strings should
/// be used by a client program for device driver selection. The property value
/// consists of a concatenated list of null terminated strings, from most
/// specific to most general. They allow a device to express its compatibility
/// with a family of similar devices, potentially allowing a single device
/// driver to match against several devices.
///
/// The recommended format is `"manufacturer,model"`, where `manufacturer` is a
/// string describing the name of the manufacturer (such as a stock ticker
/// symbol), and model specifies the model number.
///
/// The compatible string should consist only of lowercase letters, digits and
/// dashes, and should start with a letter. A single comma is typically only
/// used following a vendor prefix. Underscores should not be used.
///
/// Example: `compatible = "fsl,mpc8641", "ns16550";`
///
/// In this example, an operating system would first try to locate a device
/// driver that supported `fsl,mpc8641`. If a driver was not found, it would
/// then try to locate a driver that supported the more general `ns16550` device
/// type.
